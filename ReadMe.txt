I'm the worlds worst programmer and I also have a real job so updates will be rare... But..

For Windows 10 only: 

Automation tool for setting up performance settings!
1) Download the ZIP of all the files from GitHub!
2) Edit "DirectoryToWatch" and modify that value to hwatever directory you want to monitor for changes and/or to automate
2b) This will recursively add all exe's in that folder to the Windows settings so be careful not to load the whole C drive.. !
2c) Currently ONLY ONE DIRECTORY CAN BE ADDED AT THIS TIME!
    ie. C:\Riot Games\League of Legends
    OR 
    C:\Whatever game\whatever\

3) Close all open windows that don't need to be open
4) Run "TheFixer", don't touch anything and let it do it's thing.

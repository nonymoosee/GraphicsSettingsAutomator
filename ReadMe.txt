I'm the worlds worst programmer and I also have a real job so updates will be rare... But..

For Windows 10 only: 

Automation tool for setting up performance settings!
1) Download from GitHub!
2) Edit "DirectoryToWatch" and modify that value to hwatever directory you want to monitor for changes and/or to automate
2b) This will recursively add all exe's in that folder to the Windows settings so be careful not to load the whole C drive.. !
3) Close all open windows that don't need ot be open
4) Run "TheFixer", don't touch anything and let it do it's thing.


If the program doesn't seem to work or you get errors about image not found, use a screenshot to update the files in the "images" folder!
